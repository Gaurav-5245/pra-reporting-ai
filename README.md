🏦 PRA AI Assistant: Regulatory Compliance & COREP Mapper
An intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine designed to automate regulatory mapping for COREP (C 01.00) reporting under Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) rules.

🚀 Overview
Regulatory reporting (COREP) is often manual and prone to errors. This tool bridges the gap by using AI to interpret complex banking scenarios and map them directly to regulatory templates. It specifically handles nuanced treatments like Article 33 (Software Asset Deductions) with built-in audit trails.

✨ Key Features
Smart Document Intelligence: Uses PyPDF and LangChain to ingest and understand official PRA rulebooks.

Automated COREP Mapping: Automatically identifies relevant Row IDs (e.g., C01.01, C01.02) based on user scenarios.

Regulatory Logic Engine: Applies mandatory 20% deductions for intangible assets (Software) as per PRA standards.

Validation & Flagging: Features a "Validation Status" that identifies missing data and flags it as DATA REQUIRED.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit
AI Framework: LangChain
Embeddings: HuggingFace (sentence-transformers)
Vector Database: ChromaDB
LLM: OpenAI (via OpenRouter API)

⚖️ Disclaimer & Purpose Limitation

IMPORTANT: This tool is a demonstration prototype only.
It does not constitute regulatory, legal, or financial advice.

Not Financial Advice: The mappings and calculations (e.g., Article 33 deductions) generated by this AI are based on automated analysis and should not be used for actual regulatory filings without human expert review.

Purpose Limitation: This tool is designed to assist in understanding PRA rulebook structures and is not a substitute for professional legal or compliance advice.

Accuracy: While the tool aims for precision, LLM-generated outputs may occasionally contain inaccuracies. Always cross-reference with official PRA Rulebook documents.
